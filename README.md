# Challenge #1

## Description
This site was created to teach companies how to optimize their company for marketing online. Codebase changed to accessibility standards for search engines.

The code change done made small changes to the site for better search optimization. I have consolidatd the stylesheet to have less room and to better fit the elements in the HTML file. I have also ordered the stylesheet according to the  order of elements found on the HTML.

## Usage

Below are screenshots to provide a look at what was consolidated:

Below I am showing the consolidation done on the CSS sheet:

I have also noted on the HTML on the change that was made.
